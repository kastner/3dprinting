Slice 0.9.5 -- Through Repeteir host
====================================

Notes
-----

Altered my Z steps (from 2274 to 2300 - M8 threaded rod)
The height of this one is a little too high, but better than before.
I think somewhere between those 2 will do it

STILL stuck to the printbed tape...

Newer (but not newest) version of Slic3r, but settings the same
printed faster, but has a few holes in the top infill
a little cleaner print than #1, not as clean as #2 I think
